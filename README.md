# Hate Speech Classification

## Project Overview: 

The objective of this project is to develop a robust speech classification system that incorporates sentiment analysis and topic classification capable of identifying hate speech and/or offensive language within textual data. This system aims to delve deeper by employing topic modeling techniques to categorize such instances into relevant topics (politics, sports, entertainment, etc). This multifaceted approach seeks to not only pinpoint instances of negativity but also to understand the contextual nuances and potential societal implications, thereby contributing to the creation of safer and more informed online space. 

## Methodology:
1. **Data Acquisition:** Obtained text datasets from Kaggle and performed EDA to identify any patterns or underlying components. 
2. **Preprocess:** Text Cleaning (stopwords removal, spelling corrections, lemmatization, tokenization, etc.), Word embedding, etc. 
3. **Model Employment:** Sentiment Analsis (Logistic Regression, Bernoilli Naives Bayes, Multinomial Naives Bayes, Neural Netowork) and Topic Classification (Naive Bayes, RNN, LSTM and fine-tuned BERT)
